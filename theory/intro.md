In this section we study the differences between digital manufacturing tools, as well as specific design techniques.

You can expect to learn

 * The difference between a additive and subtractive manufacturing.
 * How to choose the correct 3D printer or other tool for the job, focusing on the pros and cons of
	* Resin printers
	* SLS printers
	* FFF printers
	* and more conventional digital manufacturing techniques like CNC mills and laser cutters
 * Work with and compare different materials, including
	* ABS
	* PLA
	* Taulman nylon 618/680
	* Art filaments, like bronzefill, woodfill, and T-Glase.
	* NinjaFlex
	* Disolvable support
 * Post proccessing
	* Acetone vapour
	* Model painting
	* Part assembly (Plumbers epoxy, etc)
	* Tetrahydrofuran vapour smoothing
 * Specific design techniques, and how to apply them to different manufacturing methods, including
	* Living hinges
	* Dealing with overhangs
	* fillets/chamfers
 * The strenghts and weakness's of different design methodologies and tools, including
	* Parametric/Programmable Design
	* Vertex Editing
	* Sculpting
 * How to diagnose hardware faults in common 3D printer designs
 * Converting your designs into toolpaths, picking the correct directives for your object, including
	* The advantages/disadvanteges of different infill levels/methods
	* Reducing object warp
	* "Bridging" overhangs
 * Working with and simulating raw GCODE toolpaths
 * 3D scanning
